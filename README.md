# photoalbum

A super simple photo album static site generator. You give it a path to a folder of
photos and other photos, and it'll generate a basic photo album in that directory. Then
you can upload that directory to a webserver of your choice (like an AWS S3 bucket) to
host it.

It's everything I need and nothing I don't.

Heavily inspired by the photoalbums found on bayarearides.com
([example](https://bayarearides.com/rides/annadel1/photos/)).
